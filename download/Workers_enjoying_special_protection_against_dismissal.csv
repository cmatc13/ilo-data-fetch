[…]<br/><br/>- Where, on expiry of the periods for which work may be interrupted on account of a bona fide accident or illness, a worker is unable to return to work, the employer should keep his or her post open for one year, counting from the expiry of such periods (art. 211 LCL).<br/><br/>- Where a worker fulfils the qualifying conditions for retirement pensions and begins the necessary formalities, the employer must maintain the employment relationship until the appropriate fund grants the benefit, for a maximum of one year (art. 252 LCL).<br/><br/>- An employer must keep a worker&apos;s post open if the latter is obliged to perform compulsory military service because of an ordinary call-up, mobilization or special call-up, and must continue to do so from the date of the call-up and until 30 days after the completion of the service (art. 214 LCL).<br/>"

As an alternative to reinstatement the employee is entitled to compensation.  <br/>(Note also that under Article 381 of the Labour Code, failure by the employer to ask for a prior formal opinion from this authority is in itself a ground of unlawfulness.) <br/><br/><u>- Workers&apos; representatives:</u> <br/>The LC prohibits the dismissal of workers&apos; representatives on the grounds of their participation in collective representation structure or trade-union affiliation or non-affiliation (art. 406) and provides them with special protection  in case of disciplinary action or dismissal (art. 410).
