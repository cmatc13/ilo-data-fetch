The prohibition of abusive dismissal can now be found under section 16 of LCA. <br/>Sec 16 of LCA: If a dismissal lacks objectively reasonable grounds and is not considered to be appropriate in general societal terms, it is treated as an abuse of rights and is invalid.<br/><br/>Note: There is no statutory provision regarding what constitutes “objectively reasonable grounds” in terms of sec. 16 of LCA.  However, rational reasons which may justify an ordinary dismissal under the doctrine of abusive dismissal --that have been established as a case law principle over the years-- can be divided into four types: (i) misconduct, (ii) incompetence, (iii) economic reasons, and (iv) requirement of union shop agreement. <br/>Sec 89 of LSA: Employers who continuously employ 10 or more workers shall draw up work rules covering, among other, matters pertaining to termination of employment, including grounds for dismissal and if disciplinary measures are set up, matters pertaining to their nature and limits, and shall submit those work rules to the relevant government agency (local labour inspectorate). <br/><br/>Note: Although there are no listed statutory grounds for both disciplinary and ordinary dismissal, these grounds are generally included in collective agreements and/or in the work rules (Shugyo-Kisoku). The causes of disciplinary action are therefore limited to those explicitly specified in the shugyo-kisoku and a disciplinary dismissal without any specified cause is void. <br/>Similarly, many collective agreements stipulate the causes and procedures for an ordinary dismissal as well as a disciplinary dismissal. The courts have held that a dismissal which is not based on the reasons specified in the collective agreement is void. Most courts have also held that a dismissal which has not gone through consultation procedures provided under collective bargaining agreements is void (See Hanami,T; Komiya, F; Yamakawa, R.: &apos;Japan&apos;, in R. Blanpain (ed.): International encyclopaedia for labour law and industrial relations (The Hague, Kluwer Law International, 2015).  <br/><br/>Regarding work rules and collective agreements, see sec. 90: In drawing up or changing the work rules, the employer shall ask the opinion of either a labor union organized by a majority of the workers at the workplace concerned (in cases where such labour union exists), or a person representing a majority of the workers (in cases where such union does not exist).  <br/>See also sec. 92: The rules of employment shall not infringe any laws and regulations or any collective agreement applicable to the workplace concerned. <br/>Sec. 17(1) of LCA provides that an employer may not dismiss a worker until the expiration of the term of such labour contract, unless there are unavoidable grounds.<br/><br/>Section 19 of LCA: if, by the expiration date of the contract term of a fixed-term labour contract which falls under any of the following items, a worker applies for a renewal of the said fixed-term labour contract, or if a worker applies for the conclusion of another fixed-term labour contract without delay after the said contract term expires, and the employer&apos;s refusal to accept the said application lacks objectively reasonable grounds and is not found to be appropriate in general societal terms, it is deemed that the employer accepts the said application with the same labour conditions as the contents of the prior fixed-term labour contract: <br/>i)the said fixed-term labour contract has been repeatedly renewed in the past, and it is found that terminating the said fixed-term labour contract by not renewing it when the contract term expires is, in general social terms, equivalent to terminating a labour contract without a fixed term by expressing the intention to fire a worker who has concluded the said labour contract without a fixed term;<br/>ii)it is found that there are reasonable grounds upon which the said Worker expects the said fixed-term labour contract to be renewed when the said fixed-term labour contract expires.<br/>"

In addition, the LA also  the employer&apos;s ability to dismiss on the grounds of redundancy. &apos;Redundancy&apos; is defined as &quot;an involuntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of manpower&quot;(sec. 20 LA). <br/>It is worth noting that according to secondary sources, there have been developments in the case law which contrast with the principle of termination at will.

Such provisions are enforceable through the grievance and arbitration process set forth in nearly all collective-bargaining agreements. The scope of such protection is limited by the low rate of union representation (12.3 % of the American workforce unionized as of 2009 in both public and private sectors in 2009, 7.2 % in the private sector - See:  http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm  (last visited June 16, 2010). <br/><u>2) Statutory protection</u>: Numerous federal laws prohibit discrimination in employment, and those laws operate to prohibit termination of employment based on certain proscribed reasons (see below prohibited grounds)<br/><u>3) Judicial protection</u>: Another protection against employment at-will comes from case law, in which there are three major exceptions namely a) public policy exception, b) the implied contract exception and c) the implied Covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <br/>a) the most widely accepted exception, recognized by forty-three states, is the public policy exception.  The public policy exception under case law is available largely to protect employees from dismissal in those situations where they refuse to commit an illegal or unethical act requested by the employer or where they choose to exercise a statutory right, for example rights under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 1970, or the Fair Labour Standards Act, 1938 (covering minimum wage and overtime). The recognition and scope of application of  this exception varies from state to state.<br/>b) the notion of a breach of an implied contract of employment. An implied contract can come from an oral or written representation, or from an employer&apos;s past practice, leading to an employee&apos;s legitimate expectation that his or her employment will not be terminated without just cause. This exception is recognized in 38 of the 50 States<br/>c) Basic contractual principles have also given rise to recognition of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in labour and employment law, leading to an assumption that dismissals should be fair and for just cause. This theory holds that a duty of good faith and fair dealing is owed in the performance and enforcement of all contracts. As of 2000, only 11 states recognized the above exception.<br/>(On those exceptions see: Muhl, Charles J., &quot;The employment-at-will doctrine: three major exceptions&quot; in Monthly Labour Review. 2001 Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 3-11 - Available at: http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf)<br/>"
